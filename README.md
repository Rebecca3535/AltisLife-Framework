<b>LifePlus</b> is a roleplaying community dedicated, solely, to entertaining our players and creating a light hearted environment for everyone. We currently aim to developing a mission file, using the <b>AsYetUntitled</b> framework and work from various developors across the ArmA 3 community. We are aiming simply to please the players - not ourselves. Anyone is free to use our mission file, improve upon it, remove, add or change anything they want at anytime without our concent and we will not take any offence regardless. If any developor has an issue with our use of your work, please contact any member of the community management team and said work will be removed. We are not trying to steal any work, all work will be appropriately credited and we will do our best not to change too much.
